# Software (Programs for CPU)

Programs compiled for RV32I/RV32IM to test the CPU.

Subfolders:
- `reference/`   — simple reference programs (add, loops, branch tests)
- `demos/`       — visual demos (Gaussian, F1, Sine wave)
- `riscv_tests/` — official rv32ui / rv32mi style tests

Goal: provide test programs for simulation + future FPGA work.
